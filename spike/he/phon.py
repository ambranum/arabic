"""Vocalized Hebrew -> Modern Israeli pronunciation. Deterministic, no lexicon.

This is the Hebrew answer to the Arabic side's CAPHI++ field, and it exists because the two
languages put the hard part in different places. Maknuune SHIPS a pronunciation per entry, and
the Arabic pipeline's difficulty is vocalization: only 46% of corpus words get their vowels
straight from the lexicon. Hebrew is the mirror image. No open Hebrew lexicon carries reliable
per-entry phonetics -- but it doesn't need to, because once a word has niqqud its Israeli
pronunciation is a FUNCTION of the spelling. So we don't look pronunciation up. We compute it,
and the only thing that has to be looked up is the niqqud.

What "Modern Israeli" means here, since it is a choice and not a fact:

  * The historical distinctions are gone, as they are in ordinary Tel Aviv speech.
    ת = ט = t.  כּ = ק = k.  ב = ו = v.  א = ע = nothing (a hiatus at most).  ח = כ = x.
    We are teaching people to be understood at a table, not to read Tiberian.
  * ר is the uvular [R]. Romanized plainly as "r" -- writing "R" would suggest a contrast
    that modern Hebrew does not have.
  * Five vowels: a e i o u. Qamatz and patach both -> a; tsere and segol both -> e. Qamatz
    qatan is the one exception and it is genuinely ambiguous in unpointed text (see below).
  * Shva: this is the only rule with real judgement in it, and it is documented at `_shva`.

Output is a plain ASCII romanization in the same spirit as CAPHI's urban realization -- what a
learner should say, not a phonemic analysis. Stress is marked with an acute on the vowel only
when it is NOT final, because Hebrew is final-stressed by default (milra) and marking the
default everywhere would be noise. Penultimate stress (mil'el) is common enough in nouns and in
the past tense that leaving it unmarked would teach the wrong word.

    This is not what the grammars say, and it is not what I wrote first. The classical account
    has shva na word-initially, after a long stressed vowel, in the second of two adjacent
    shvas, and under a dagesh hazaq. I implemented three of those and then measured all eight
    combinations against 14,710 Wiktionary romanizations (spike/he/verify_phon.py). Every extra

    shilema. Teaching the classical rule would be teaching a register nobody speaks.

    is a trap in the other direction: under a guttural it costs 1.5pp, before one it costs
    5.2pp. It fixes 175 words and breaks 968.

    The residue is real but small, and it lands almost entirely on verb forms (יִכְתְּבוּ is
